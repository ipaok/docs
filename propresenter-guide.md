- When he’s wrapping up with the welcome, and before the sermon starts, display the "Children's Church Dismissed" slide.
- Display Sermon slides sent by the speaker, if they’re just asking for bible references, display those on ProPresenter.
- Once the sermon finishes, switch to a blank slide as the worship leader begins again.
- Stay on the blank slide for the Pastor's closing prayer.
- After that, it's announcement time! When Jimmy (or whoever's up) starts, show the first announcement slide and cue up the Spotify church mix (still muted).
- Roll through the announcements, when Jimmy (or whoever else) walks off stage, end it off with the outro video, gradually turning up the Spotify volume.
- That's the rundown for the Graphics/Lyrics volunteer. Thank you so much for serving today!
