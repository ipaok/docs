## Operations

- When you come in turn on lights #2 and #3. Lights #1 and #4 will remain off throughout the service.
    ![](img/2024-08-12-18-02-17.png)
- Open up church mix songs playlist on Spotify, and have it ready to play.
- Start the music on Spotify at 10:20 am.
- Kick off the countdown at 10:26 am.
- When the countdown hits 4:00, smoothly lower the Spotify volume as the countdown video takes over.
- When the countdown hits 30 seconds, turn off the house lights # 2 and #3.
    ![](img/2024-08-12-18-02-28.png)
- After the countdown, welcome everyone with the welcome graphic until the worship team takes the stage.
- When the worship leads starts to speak or song display the first song (blank) slide to start the "Worship ends in" countdown.
- During worship, keep an eye on the lyrics and switch slides as needed.
- When worship wraps up, the Pastor will speak and welcome. Turn on lights #2 and #3 as soon as he starts the welcome.
    ![](img/2024-08-12-18-02-40.png)
- When he’s wrapping up with the welcome, and before the sermon starts, display the "Children's Church Dismissed" slide.
- Display Sermon slides sent by the speaker, if they’re just asking for bible references, display those on ProPresenter.
- Once the sermon finishes, switch to a blank slide as the worship leader begins again.
- Stay on the blank slide for the Pastor's closing prayer.
- After that, it's announcement time! When Jimmy (or whoever's up) starts, show the first announcement slide and cue up the Spotify church mix (still muted).
- Roll through the announcements, when Jimmy (or whoever else) walks off stage, end it off with the outro video, gradually turning up the Spotify volume.
- That's the rundown for the Graphics/Lyrics volunteer. Thank you so much for serving today!

## FAQs

- What’s a Library and a Playlist?
    ![](img/2024-08-12-18-02-54.png)
    
    - The "Library" is a section where you store and organize all your media files, such as slides, images, videos, and audio files. It acts as a central repository for all your presentation assets.
    - A "playlist" in ProPresenter is a collection of media items that are arranged in a specific order for the Sunday Service. Playlists can include slides, videos, songs, or any other type of media supported by ProPresenter. They provide a structured way to organize and present content during Sunday Services.
