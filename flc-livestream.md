## Introduction

First and foremost ***thank you so much*** for giving your time to do this! You may be working behind the scenes, but your work does not go unnoticed.

This guide will help walk you through the live stream setup and operations process here at IPA. Feel free to reach out to the media director if you would like a more in-depth training as this is a condensed version of everything that goes into live stream operations. 

### Set-up

1. Start by turning on the video rack. Locate the red switches and set them to the "on" position. (The lyrics station typically turns this on, so if its already on then move onto step 2).

14. Once the song is done, reposition Camera 1 to Pastor or whoever is doing the ending prayer. 
15. After the ending prayer, the admin director will come up to do announcements, make sure you’re showing the slides using the PP7 button, and switching back and forth to video and slides just like the sermon.
