### ProPresenter 7: Displaying Bible Verses and Returning to the Current Program

#### 1. Displaying Bible Verses

ProPresenter 7 offers a streamlined process for displaying Bible verses during your presentation, whether for quick references or more structured scripture reading.

**Steps to Display Bible Verses:**

1. **Open ProPresenter 7:**
   - Launch the ProPresenter 7 application and ensure your presentation is loaded.

2. **Access the Bible Feature:**
   - Click on the **Bibles** button located on the toolbar at the top of the screen. If itâ€™s not visible, go to `View > Bibles` to open the Bible search window.

3. **Search for a Verse:**
   - In the Bible search window, enter the book name, chapter, and verse (e.g., "John 3:16") into the search bar.
   - Select the desired Bible version from the dropdown menu if you have multiple versions available.

4. **Select and Customize the Verse:**
   - Once the verse appears, you can select it and adjust its appearance using the formatting options in ProPresenter 7. This includes changing the font, size, color, and background.

5. **Send the Verse to the Screen:**
   - Click on the **Send to Audience** button to display the verse on your output screens.
   - The Bible verse will be overlaid on your current presentation, appearing in real-time on the live output.

6. **Creating a Slide from the Verse (Optional):**
   - You can also add the verse directly to a new slide by dragging it from the Bible window to your presentation playlist or clicking on **Save to Library** for future use.

#### 2. Returning to the Current Program

After displaying a Bible verse, you may want to return to your scheduled presentation content.

**Steps to Return to the Current Program:**

1. **Access the Show Controls:**
   - In ProPresenter 7, the **Show Controls** are located at the bottom of the screen. This area shows the active slide and upcoming slides, allowing for quick navigation.

2. **Return to the Previous Slide:**
   - To return to the last active slide, simply click on it in the **Show Controls** area or use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate back to the previous slide.
   - If you were using a dedicated Bible presentation section, you might need to switch back to your main slide deck. You can do this by selecting the appropriate playlist or slide deck from the left sidebar.

3. **Clear the Bible Verse:**
   - If the Bible verse remains on the screen, use the **Clear Layer** buttons at the top right of the screen. Choose **Clear All** or **Clear Text** to remove the Bible verse from the live output, returning to your main presentation content.

4. **Resume Your Presentation:**
   - After clearing the verse, continue with your presentation as planned. You can advance through your slides using the arrow keys or by clicking on the slides in the **Show Controls** area.

ProPresenter 7's intuitive interface allows for easy transitions between displaying Bible verses and returning to your main presentation, ensuring smooth and professional worship services or events.
