**Thanks for being a part of this team and being willing to capture the moments that make IPA the community that it is.**

## INTRODUCTION TO PHOTOGRAPHY

Welcome to the IPA photography team! Capturing beautiful and meaningful moments requires some basic knowledge of photography, especially in low light conditions commonly found during church services.

### Key Tips for Low Light Photography:

1. **Shutter Speed:** Keep your shutter speed at 1/200 or 1/160. This will help reduce motion blur and ensure your images are sharp and clear.
2. **Aperture:** Set your aperture to f/2.4 or below. A wider aperture allows more light to reach the camera sensor, which is essential in dim environments.

By using these settings, you'll be better equipped to handle the challenges of low light photography and capture stunning images that reflect the vibrant community at IPA.

## GOAL

Shoot and upload 20-30 shots that you love and that capture the vibe of IPA.

## SHOTS TO GET (In both portrait and landscape)

1. People laughing, smiling, talking, getting coffee, etc. in the lobby.
2. Volunteers serving - Hospitality team, greeters, media team, etc.
3. Speakers - The main speaker, announcements and transition/prayer moments.
4. Children's ministry - The kids and the volunteers/teachers.
5. Worship - People worshiping and the Worship Team. (Try not to be disruptive.)

*It’s okay to ask people to pose or tell them you are taking their picture. We want them to be happy with the picture too.*

## PURPOSE

1. To capture the service and special moments/events for:
    1. Social media posts - Take pictures in both portrait and landscape setting.
    2. Website photo refreshers.
    3. Future events and seasonal recaps.

*If you have a picture or pictures that you think are incredible and would be great for a social media post, let Jeff know with the specific picture(s).*

**Wear** dark colors (specifically your top) when shooting in the service as you will be less noticeable in the FLC.
