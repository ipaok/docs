Whether you're designing social media graphics, flyers, presentations, or other promotional materials, Canva offers a wide range of templates, graphics, and tools to bring your ideas to life.

## **Recap of Last Year's Projects**

Before we delve into our future projects, let's take a moment to reflect on some of the key design projects our team worked on last year:

1. **Social Media Graphics**: Designed eye-catching graphics for our church's social media platforms, including event promotions, inspirational quotes, and announcements.

5. **Printed Materials**: Designed printed materials such as brochures, banners, and signage for use within our church events.

## **Developing a Style Guide**

While we've produced some designs, it's essential to establish a cohesive visual identity for IPA. A style guide will serve as a roadmap for maintaining consistency across all our design projects. As we embark on this journey, here are some elements to consider when developing our style guide:

1. **Color Palette**: Select a set of colors that reflect the essence of our church and evoke the desired emotions. Consider incorporating our church's logo colors into the palette for consistency.
2. **Typography**: Choose a primary font for headings and a secondary font for body text to ensure readability and visual harmony across all materials.
3. **Imagery Guidelines**: Determine the types of imagery that align with our church's values and messaging. This may include photographs of church events, illustrations, or relevant stock images.
4. **Logo Usage**: Define guidelines for the usage of our church logo, including size, placement, and acceptable variations.
5. **Voice and Tone**: Establish guidelines for the tone of our written content to ensure consistency in communication style across various platforms.
6. **Design Elements**: Identify consistent design elements such as borders, patterns, or icons that can be used to enhance our materials and reinforce our brand identity.
7. **Accessibility**: Ensure that our designs are accessible to all individuals, including those with disabilities, by following best practices for color contrast, font size, and alternative text for images.

As we work together to define our style guide, we encourage everyone to contribute their ideas and insights to create a visual identity that truly represents IPA and resonates with our community.
